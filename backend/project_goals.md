# Clank Clank Mushi - Project Goals

The main goal of the "Clank Clank Mushi" project is to create a personal, intelligent application for consuming anime news and exploring anime lore. This app aims to be more than just a news feed; it's designed to be an interactive companion that enhances understanding and engagement with anime content.

### Specific Project Goals

* **Functional News Aggregation:** Successfully connect to and fetch news articles from at least one external anime news API. The retrieved articles should be displayed clearly on the application's interface.

* **Robust LLM Backend Integration:** Implement a stable backend using Flask and Python to seamlessly communicate with the Google Gemini API (or a specified Ollama LLM if configured). This integration will be the backbone for all AI-powered features.

* **Intuitive User Prompt Chat:** Develop a user-friendly chat interface that allows users to type free-form questions and receive relevant text-based responses from the LLM. This chat should be easily accessible from anywhere in the application.

* **Contextual Suggested Questions:** Implement logic to automatically generate and display a set of LLM-powered questions relevant to the current page's content (e.g., a specific news article) or general anime topics when no article is active.

* **"Lore Navigator" Feature:** Create the functionality for users to query the LLM about specific anime terms, characters, or concepts, receiving concise explanations and related information on demand.

* **"Trendspotter" Feature:** Develop the capability for the LLM to analyze aggregated news data, identify emerging trends, perform sentiment analysis, and generate speculative predictions about future anime industry developments.

* **"Debate Arena" Feature:** Implement a system where the LLM can process user-defined scenarios or debates and provide balanced pro/con summaries based on its knowledge of anime lore.

* **Localhost Operability:** Ensure the entire application is configured to run smoothly and reliably on `localhost:8001`, as it is intended for personal use.
* **MVC Architecture Adherence:** Structure the codebase following the Model-View-Controller pattern to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability for future enhancements.
