Welcome, Senpai! Mushi is here to be your personal AI companion for the vast and wonderful world of anime. This app is more than just a streaming site; it's a smart, context-aware platform designed to enhance your anime journey by bringing news, data, and intelligent chat to your fingertips.

This project is a full-stack anime platform featuring an AI chat assistant powered by a local RAG pipeline, dynamic data ingestion and visualization, and a modern streaming interface.

## ‚ú® Core Features <img src="./mushi-frontend/public/mushi_snail_nami.png" alt="Nami Snail" width="30" align="top">

Clank Clank Mushi combines a smooth anime discovery and watching experience with a powerful, custom-built AI brain.

* **üì∫ Modern Anime Streaming:** Watch your favorite anime with a clean, modern player. Easily switch between servers and track your episodes.

* **üß† The Whispering Snail (Mushi AI Chat):** The heart of the app! Click the Mushi snail floating on the screen to open a chat window. Ask Mushi anything about anime, get summaries of series, explore complex lore, or even have it suggest what to watch next.

* **‚ö° RAG-Powered Context:** Mushi isn't just a generic chatbot. It uses a custom **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. When you ask a question, it first searches its own dedicated knowledge base to find relevant context before generating an answer. This makes its responses incredibly accurate and specialized for anime topics.

* **üîç Smart Search & Discovery:** Find anime with a powerful search that includes live suggestions. Use the advanced filter panel to drill down by genre, type, score, status, and more.

* **üìä Interactive Data Insights:** Ever wondered how different anime are connected? The "Data Insights" page provides a 2D visualization of Mushi's entire knowledge base, clustering related topics together. It's a visual map of the anime universe!

* **üîê Admin Control Panel:** A secure admin area allows for manual data ingestion and management, giving you full control over Mushi's knowledge.

## üöÄ Getting Started <img src="./mushi-frontend/public/mushi_snail_chopper.png" alt="Chopper Snail" width="30" align="top">

Ready to power up your own Mushi? Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed on your system:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.9 or higher recommended)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or higher recommended)
* [Ollama](https://ollama.com/): **This is essential for the AI.** It runs large language models locally on your machine.
* A package manager for Node.js like `pnpm` or `npm`. This guide uses `pnpm`.

### 1. Ollama AI Setup

Before launching the app, you need to give Mushi its brain. Open your terminal and run the following command to download the model that powers Mushi's knowledge embedding:

```bash
ollama pull snowflake-arctic-embed:latest
```

(This model converts anime data into a format the AI can understand. The app will fail to build its database without it! The app will also automatically pull a qwen2 model for chat when you first run it).

### 2. Backend Setup <img src="./mushi-frontend/public/mushi_snail_zoro.png" alt="Zoro Snail" width="30" align="top">

The backend is a Python Flask server that handles the AI, data, and API requests.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LatchyCat/Clank_Clank_Mushi.git
cd Clank_Clank_Mushi

# 2. Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# 3. Set up a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# 4. Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Create your environment file (if you want to use the optional Gemini LLM)
# If you don't have a Gemini key, you can skip this step. The app defaults to local Ollama.
cp .env.example .env
# now open .env and add your key: GEMINI_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# 6. !!! CRITICAL STEP: Build the Knowledge Base !!!
# This script ingests data, creates vector embeddings, and caches them.
# This one-time setup is REQUIRED before the first run.
python3 build_database.py

# 7. Run the Flask backend server
python3 app.py
```

Your backend should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:8001. You'll see log messages indicating that it's ready!

### 3. Frontend Setup <img src="./mushi-frontend/public/mushi_snail_sanji.png" alt="Sanji Snail" width="30" align="top">

The frontend is a modern React application built with Vite.

```bash
# 1. In a NEW terminal, navigate to the frontend directory from the project root
cd Clank_Clank_Mushi/mushi-frontend

# 2. Install the required Node.js packages
pnpm install

# 3. Run the Vite development server
pnpm dev
```

Your frontend should now be running! Open your web browser to http://localhost:5173 to use the app.

## üõ† How It Works: The Mushi Architecture <img src="./mushi-frontend/public/mushi_snail_franky.png" alt="Franky Snail" width="30" align="top">

The application is a monorepo composed of a Python backend and a React frontend.

### Mushi Frontend (React + Vite):
* This is the user interface you interact with in the browser.
* Built with React, it provides a dynamic and responsive user experience.
* Vite serves the application with an incredibly fast development server and optimized production builds.
* React Router handles all the client-side navigation, making the app feel snappy.
* Artplayer and HLS.js are used to create the robust video streaming experience.
* The entire UI is styled with Tailwind CSS, making it modern and easy to maintain.

### Mushi Backend (Python + Flask):
* The backend is a lightweight Flask server that acts as the application's central nervous system.
* It contains the crucial video Proxy & Decryption logic which securely fetches and decodes video stream URLs from external sources, making them playable.
* Cloudscraper and Beautiful Soup are used to scrape anime information from various web sources.

### The Mushi "Brain" (AI & Data Layer):
* **Ollama Integration:** The AI Chat is powered by local LLMs running on Ollama. This ensures privacy and zero API costs for the core chat functionality.
* **Vector Database & RAG:** At its core, Mushi uses a faiss-cpu powered VectorStore. The DataEmbeddingService takes all scraped anime information, converts it into numerical representations (embeddings) using the snowflake-arctic-embed model, and stores them. This Retrieval-Augmented Generation process makes the AI an anime expert.
* **Data Visualization:** The Data Insights page uses K-Means clustering (scikit-learn) on the vector data to group similar anime and topics. The results are visualized in the browser using D3.js.
