# Clank Clank Mushi

Hey there! This is "Clank Clank Mushi," a little project I'm working on just for myself. It's like having your own personal AI helper for all things anime.

### What It Is

So, you know how sometimes you want to catch up on anime news or just learn more about your favorite shows? That's what "Clank Clank Mushi" helps with. It's a website that lives on your computer.

It brings you the latest anime news. But here's the cool part: it has a smart AI built right in. You can ask it questions about anything anime-related, even if it's not directly in the news article you're reading.

### What It Does For You

* **Gets the News:** First off, it finds and shows you the newest anime news stories. Easy to see what's happening.

* **Chat with the AI (The "Whispering Snail"):** See that little snail button? Click it! A chat box pops up. You can type almost anything you want to know. Like, "Can you sum up this news article?" or "What if Character X fought Character Y?" The AI will try its best to answer you.

* **Gets You Thinking (Little "Thought Bubbles"):** Sometimes, you might not have a question ready. No problem! When you're looking at a news story, or even just the main news page, the app will show you a few little "thought bubbles" with questions you might like to ask. Just click one, and the AI will answer it for you. It's like a friendly nudge.

* **Explains Stuff (The "Lore Navigator"):** Ever read a news story and see a word or name you don't recognize, maybe from a show you haven't watched yet? You can highlight that word. The app will then use its AI to quickly tell you what it means. It's like having a super fast dictionary for anime lore right there. It can even show you other news or info related to that word.

* **Finds What's Hot (The "Trendspotter"):** Want to know what everyone's buzzing about in the anime world? The app's AI can look at lots of news and tell you what people are generally feeling about new shows or big announcements. It can even give you some ideas about what kind of anime might be popular in the future.

* **Helps with Debates (The "Debate Arena"):** Ever wonder, "Who would win in a fight between these two characters?" or "What's the best theory about this plot twist?" You can ask the AI. It will give you a balanced look at different ideas, pulling from what it knows about the anime world. It helps you think things through without arguing with anyone!

### How to Use It (On Your Computer)

This app is for your own use, and it runs on your computer. Here's the simple version:

1.  **Start it up:** You'll open something called a "terminal" or "command prompt" on your computer. You'll type a simple command there to get the app running.
2.  **Open your web browser:** After the app starts, you'll open your internet browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and go to a special address: `http://localhost:8001`. That's where the app lives on your computer.
3.  **Explore the news:** Once it's open, you'll see the latest anime news. Click on any headline to read the full story.
4.  **Chat with the AI:** Look for the snail icon. Click it to open the chat. Type your questions there.
5.  **Get suggestions:** Just look for the little bubbles next to articles or on the main page. Click them to learn more.
6.  **Highlight for info:** If you see something you don't know, just highlight it with your mouse, and an option will pop up to ask the AI.

That's it! It's designed to be pretty easy to use once it's up and running.

I hope this roadmap and these `README.md` files give us a fantastic foundation to start building, Oriel! Let me know if you want to adjust anything or if you're ready to dive into the first bits of code.
